Copyright (c) GLYPHICONS.com

This is a legal agreement between you, the customer, and GLYPHICONS.com,
the seller. By downloading icons from GLYPHICONS.com you agree to be bound
by the terms of this license terms.

The license is non-exclusive, non-sublicensable and non-transferable and it is
always tied with one email address, unique order ID (you may find this number
in your first email with download link) and the name of the customer.

Customer can be either a natural person (individual human being) or a legal
person (company/business).

This license is intended only for end customers; therefore you cannot purchase
icons on behalf of someone else. GLYPHICONS.com does not cooperate with
any resellers, each customer have to buy license directly.


What is allowed

You may use icons in personal or commercial projects, repeatedly and
you do not need to buy an extra license for every new project.

Every customer can lend icons to officially contracted employees during
the time they work in your company, but you are fully responsible for how
they are being used.

The price includes future updates of the product, which means that no
additional purchase is required and you will receive new updates
automatically in your mailbox as soon, as the new version is available.

You do not have to indicate the name of the author or giving any credits
to GLYPHICONS.com, although it is always appreciated.


What is not allowed

You cannot use icons in any product intended for further processing or
where your customer is not a final owner. It is strictly prohibited to
bundle icons in any HTML themes, frameworks, as a library of
shapes/images or wherever icons would generate a significant value of
the final product.

Also, it isn’t possible to use them on a product where the icons would be
used repeatedly in larger series. For example as prints of t-shirts, mugs,
posters or any other product which have a character of repeated production.

It is not allowed to resell the icons (license) as such, because the icons
remain the intellectual property of the author.


Any other use must be approved in writing. It is not possible to request any
changes in this license before or after the purchase.

If customer violates any terms and conditions in this license, it will terminate
this license automatically.

All icons are provided "as they are" without a warranty of any kind, either
expressed or implied. GLYPHICONS.com is not liable for any damages or loss of
profits (earnings) caused of any defects in these icon sets.
